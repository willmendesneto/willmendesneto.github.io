  This time I'll share a quick code tip. Usually, when writing unit tests on components there's a common usage/pitfal. Some teams can start describing only and exclusively what the code does instead of the intentions around the code exists.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This post will talk only and exclusively about the way to write tests that makes sense to humans, so we it won't cover Test Driven Development - AKA TDD. TDD is not a design tool. It‚Äôs a software development workflow that has prompts for code improvement in its lifecycle. ‚ö†Ô∏è

## The problem

If you're looking at unit tests content, eventually you might find some posts, articles and such mentioning phrases like "tests are a way of documenting your code". But, are they really?

They should, of course! However, I rarely heard about some deep and technical discussions around standards, clarifications or any matter to read the tests and understand what's happening in there.

## Writing unit tests that are real and live documentation of your code

This time I'll share a quick code tip. Usually, when writing unit tests on components there's a common usage/pitfal. Some teams can start describing only and exclusively what the code does instead of the intentions around the code exists.

For this example, we'll play with some test cases for a component called "Quick Search", a fancy name for another search component üòú

### Less focus on component internals


Nobody cares if your callback has been called, but everybody cares about component behaviors working as expected

### Main focus on what, how and why the feature exists

### That‚Äôs all for¬†now

This was a quick one, but I hope you enjoyed this reading as much as I enjoyed writing it. Thank you so much for reading until the end and see you soon!
