I was asked to make a presentation about some changes I've done in a famous Wagering platform in Australia at DevFest Siberia, a Russian conference in Novosibirsk in September of 2017.

The talk is sharing some common issues we can find in every project, such as how to improve performance, architecture, maintainability and other topics to evolve your platform and some patterns and approaches you can use to make it easier, sharing how that worked and the benefits of using them.

This is the video of my talk published on Youtube.


Unfortunately the video couldn't show the code example, but if you are interested in check the code and understand the approach, that's the repository I shared with the Micro frontend approach.

I am really happy and proud of this presentation. I was really excited, because this presentation was on the biggest stage and at really good time and in a amazing audience and country.

If you like it, feel free to share it with other programmers, developers and engineers. I would like to share my congratulations for all conference organisers, speakers and audience. You are amazing!
