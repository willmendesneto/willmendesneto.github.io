There’s no “black or white” in this are and it can be different based on various aspects, such as personal experience, culture, etc.</em></p>\n<p>I really like the psychologic aspect of software craftsmanship, which is how different people with different lifestyles and backgrounds can help each other on the same goal of “<em>get</em> <strong><em>things</em></strong> <em>done</em>”.</p>\n<p>This is a small summary of things I’ve learned, lived and hear from other folks during my whole life working in IT. Just thought that can be a good read and hope you folks enjoy to read it as much as I enjoyed to write up these points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>“Honesty is a very expensive gift”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The feedback step requires some emphasis in human aspects, such as being empathetic, transparent and care about and wanna see the best of the person — as always! Since we’re great people and feedback is one of our value, let’s start asking 2 questions based on the different aspects of the feedback loop actors:</p>\n<p><strong><em>What should I keep in mind …</em></strong></p>\n<h3>If I’m giving a feedback …</h3>\n<p>That’s what the papers consider as <em>“the active actor”</em> or “<em>The Sender</em>“<em>.</em> It’s the person who’s giving a feedback and based on the way that message is passed it can pass some wrong idea or give a good understanding to the receptor, the person who’s hearing that.</p>\n<h3>Growth orientated</h3>\n<p>It’s always good to ask yourself about your feedback. Keep in mind questions like “Am I giving it in a way that conveys my respect for this person and my desire to help them improve as a teammate/professional/person?“.</p>\n<p>If you ask yourself about it and the answer is not <em>yes</em>, rethink about it, maybe you need to check if this is a valid point or the way you’re thinking in give it can’t be the best.</p>\n<h3>Specificity as much as you can</h3>\n<p><em>TL;DR; Be specific. Yeah, that’s the summary of this section!</em></p>\n<p>be specific about your observations, the impact of the specified points affected you and/or other people, inside or outside your team. If this is not clear for you at the first moment you can do an easy exercise.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><em>Situation</em></strong> <em>>>></em> <strong><em>Observation</em></strong> <em>>>></em> <strong><em>Impact on me/team/company</em></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Organize your ideas in that way can help you with your main goal, which shows that you care about the person.</p>\n<h3>Be focused and supportive as a foundation</h3>\n<p>Everyone has growth areas and give a feedback like <em>“You’re awesome, keep rocking“</em> is not a useful feedback without examples of why you’re saying that.</p>\n<h3>If I’m receiving a feedback …</h3>\n<p>That’s what the papers consider as <em>“the passive actor”</em> or <em>“The Receptor“</em> and when you’re receiving a feedback you need to remind yourself of some points. And at that point you.</p>\n<h3>Appreciate it</h3>\n<p>Regardless of the takeaways, make sure to thank them sincerely. Show appreciation for someone who cares about you is always a good tip.</p>\n<h3>Constructive</h3>\n<p>When you’re receiving a feedback try to avoid explaining or justifying.</p>\n<h3>Listen to the message to understand it and ask for clarification if needed</h3>\n<p>Be an effective listener. Hear what the person has to say and be open for that, make sure your body language and/or facial expression is showing that you care about it — body language is about 70% of our communication and if we, by mistake, send a wrong message we can inhibit the person to give you feedback in the future — and make sure you’re paying attention of what’s happening at that moment!</p>\n<p>Sometimes we receive a feedback, but the idea is not clear at the first moment we’re talking about it. If that’s the case, feel free to ask for clarification — an example of the attitude can help you to understand — but <em>please</em> don’t overwhelm the person who’s giving you feedback with a lot of questions.</p>\n<h3>Time to summarize and think about it</h3>\n<p>Don’t let the little voice in your brain that may be formulating your response distract you from understanding what is being said. Summarizing, is a useful tool to ensure you are hearing the feedback clearly.</p>\n<hr/>\n<h3>That’s all for today</h3>\n<p>The idea of this post was to share some points about feedback. Of course, there’s a lot of different ways to give a feedback, but in summary, they share kinda the same idea: A feedback informal or formal should be the key of build trust in your team.</p>\n<p>A lot of different teams and/or companies have different ways to encourage that, such as coffee + walk, meetings, <a href=\"https://performancepointers.wordpress.com/tag/fast-feedback/\" title=\"https://performancepointers.wordpress.com/tag/fast-feedback/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">fast feedback</a> or even weekly team feedback (which is what some teams at Facebook and Google are doing, removing retrospectives from the team ceremony list — interesting point actually). Which one is the best?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The best way to give and receive feedback is the way that works for your team. Empathy is the key</strong> 🔑</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Cya 👋</h4>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 03, 2018","path":"/posts/feedback-is-a-gift-lets-talk-about-it","title":"Feedback is a gift, let’s talk about it!","tags":["blog","soft-skills"]},"timeToRead":4}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1559850390","63159454"]}
