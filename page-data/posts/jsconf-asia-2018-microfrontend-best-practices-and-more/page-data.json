We start them with the goal of validate the business and after that we realise we have to improve the application. In some points the pages are so coupled that's hard to deliver fast, do it with proper confidence or even scale the project page by page having lot of benefits, such as start resilient decoupled applications!</p>\n<p>This is the video of my talk published at JSConf channel on Youtube.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kphwg2IsJfA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/Kphwg2IsJfA/0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<hr/>\n<p>Unfortunately, I can't show the code example, but if you are interested in check the code and understand the approach, that’s the repository I shared with the Micro frontend approach.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/willmendesneto/micro-frontend-pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>willmendesneto/micro-frontend-pages</strong>\n_micro-frontend-pages — Docker orchestration for micro Frontend pages</a></p>\n<p>You can also check the slides of this talk on my Slides.com:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://slides.com/willmendesneto/micro-frontend-a-microservice-architecture-from-your-frontend-web-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">**Micro Frontend: a microservice architecture from your frontend web apps</a></p>\n<p>I am really happy and proud of this presentation and share some of the points about Micro Frontend with some folks, having great chats after my talk…that's the best feedback I can receive.</p>\n<p>If you like it, feel free to share it with other programmers, developers and engineers.
